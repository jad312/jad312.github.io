    <h1>Optimizing Maternal-Child Health: Research, Education, and Practice to Optimize Lactation Goal Attainment</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my GitHub page! I’m Dr. Jess Davis, PhD, RN, CCRN, IBCLC. I am clinician scientist dedicated to advancing research in maternal and child health, particularly in the realms of lactation support to enhance long-term health. Here, you'll discover a curated selection of my projects that explore the vital role of breastfeeding in supporting infants with congenital heart conditions and the unique challenges faced by mothers and families.
My work is rooted in understanding the experiences of families as they navigate the parenthood, with a special focus on those experiencing the complexities of caring for a child with a congenital heart defect. I aim to create community-centered interventions that empower mothers, enhance their breastfeeding journeys, and provide the support families need during these critical times. By integrating innovative support strategies, I strive to promote health equity and ensure that every family has access to the resources and care they deserve.
Whether you’re a parent or family member, fellow researcher, healthcare professional, or someone passionate about improving maternal health, I invite you to explore, collaborate, and contribute to our mission of fostering healthier beginnings for all families. Let’s make a difference together!</p>
